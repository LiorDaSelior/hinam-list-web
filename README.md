# HinamList

**HinamList** is a shopping list optimizer application that helps you save money by intelligently distributing your purchases across multiple retail chains. Instead of ordering from a single retailer, HinamList analyzes your shopping list and determines an optimal distribution to minimize total cost while fulfilling all your needs.
